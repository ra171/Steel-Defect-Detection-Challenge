## Introduction 
With the help of __machine learning__ and __computer vision__, it is possible to detect the defects in steel with the use of some of the annotated examples of images where there are defects. Therefore, this could save a lot of time and effort when there is no need to use human aid in the detection, therefore speeding up the process of detecting the defects in steel. It would surely increase the value that it gives to the companies if they are able to detect the defects in steel early before giving those to different constructors. As a result, the construction industry would thrive in the process as a result of using machine learning and deep learning.

## Computer Vision 
Since we are going to be dealing with images, the problem at hand is a Computer Vision Problem. In this project, __Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)__ were used in the process of prediction of defects in the steel. Hyperparameter tuning was done to ensure that proper machine learning insights are generated. We would be first converting those images into the form of vectors so that we are able to give to the machine learning models for prediction respectively. 

## Outcomes

* __InceptionV3__ Network was able to perform well on the test data with an accuracy of __85%__ on the data. 
* This model with deployed in real-time with __Flask__, __HTML__ and __CSS__. 
* An user is able to upload the images and understand the defects in steel.
